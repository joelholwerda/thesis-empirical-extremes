"196952","{""Q0"":""I tried not to pick the purple squares later in the game because early on they kept coming up 0's. If I had a choice between red and purple, I decided to play it safe and take the 10 points from the red square than risk not getting points at all. I clicked the blue ones as I found early on they were worth the most followed by green. Yellow and orange were the most tricky as they were the closest together point wise. It was difficult to pick between these two but more often than not, I would choose orange. ""}","comments","survey-text","231","1512211","0.0-24.0","70931","500609","highRank"
