"174174","{""Q0"":""during the 5 trials i never once clicked a tan box so i was unsure how to answer the questions about it.  i just put 0 in the box of the number i think of. 90 seemed like too good of a deal to pass up so i selected purple exclusively after i clicked it the first time.\n\nStrategy- never click red again after getting 0 no matter what. pick green over yellow for a more consistent point gain.""}","comments","survey-text","228","1265928","0.0-24.0","64599","252879","lowRank"
