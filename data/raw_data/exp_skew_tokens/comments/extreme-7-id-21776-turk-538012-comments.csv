"220170","{""Q0"":""Once I found a few colors that gave consistent scores, like blue, green and red. I stuck to those choices, believing they would give me the highest score overall. \nInstead of gambling on the other colors, like purple giving 20 or 0 points. \n\nNo technical problems. I enjoyed this experiment. Good luck with your research!""}","comments","survey-text","228","1157223","0.0-24.0","21776","538012","highRank"
