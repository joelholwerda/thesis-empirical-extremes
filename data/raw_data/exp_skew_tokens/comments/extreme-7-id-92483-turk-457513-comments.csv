"126411","{""Q0"":""This experiment was fun! I learned that yellow always seemed to be worth 90 and purple was usually 100 or 70/80 (can't remember which). Blue was good sometimes, too. Green seemed to always be 50. Red and orange seemed to be the worst, although I became reluctant to pick them, so maybe they were good times that I didn't choose them.""}","comments","survey-text","228","1377594","0.0-24.0","92483","457513","lowRank"
