"228977","{""Q0"":""Very interesting and fun! It took me a short while to realize that each color had a correlating couple of numbers that occurred at somewhat random frequencies (it seemed.) I really enjoyed learning which were the better choices (though it looks like I missed a few for a while.) My 'mouse-clicking muscle' got tired and jerky the longer I went - and I'll admit I began to have a fear in the back of my mind that Amazon would sign me out before I was done.  A really fun study!  Oh, I noticed that I had to closely pay attention and not randomly click towards the end - something like 'color perception getting a little tired.'  Thanks so much for a great study - and your generosity!""}","comments","survey-text","228","1800784","0.0-24.0","54277","315508","highRank"
