"154436","{""Q0"":""There were a couple of colors (green especially) that I just stopped picking after I got zero a couple of times and assumed that they just didn't give points.  I know that blue gave such a high point total that I didn't even try red until the last section, when I was surprised how high a total it got!  I tried to make an association at one point between which side the color appeared on and the point total it gave, but it seemed to be random.  I wondered if there was a sequence of color choices, but couldn't find one.""}","comments","survey-text","228","1226186","0.0-24.0","60253","920967","lowRank"
