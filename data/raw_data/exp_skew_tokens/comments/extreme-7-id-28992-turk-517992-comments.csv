"134122","{""Q0"":""For my strategy, i did occasionally switch to a color that i assumed could give me lower value to see if i would get lucky. For example, choosing a yellow and hoping for 100 vs getting a 90 with a blue. I wasn't sure if each selection was random or if the values were concrete but switched at random times, and i couldn't think of a way to test this during the experiment. No technical issues, everything was very clear and well done. ""}","comments","survey-text","228","1714532","0.0-24.0","28992","517992","lowRank"
