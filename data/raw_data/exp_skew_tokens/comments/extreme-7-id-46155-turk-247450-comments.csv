"240626","{""Q0"":""My monitor is at its last life, so the colors might look more washed out depending on the location. I tried my best despite of that. At first, I didn't know that each box would have a specific number, until I caught on and then tested out to see which color gave which number. Orange tends to be the best, then green, then blue, then yellow and finally purple. From then on it was pretty easy.
