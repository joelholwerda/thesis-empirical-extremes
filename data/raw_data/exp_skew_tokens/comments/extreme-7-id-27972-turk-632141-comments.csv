"305320","{""Q0"":""At first, I chose by color preference. Then, I noticed that some colors always had the same amount of points and others varied between two numbers. SFor example, I noticed that green was always 90, but orange switched between 80 and 100. Yellow was always 50, but purple switched between 30 and 70. I tried to look for a pattern. So, for example, I tried choosing the orange multiple times in a row or the purple multiple times in a row to see if I noticed a pattern and could guess when I'd get the higher number of points. At one point (I believe in round 1), I thought the pattern for orange was left = 80, right = 100. However, I had trouble maintaining the pattern in my head as the rounds continued. If I was not sure, I picked the option that was always the same (ex: yellow or green). I got 0 at least two times with blue, so I just stuck to choosing red (versus looking for a pattern) so I wouldn't risk the 0. \n\nAt the very start of the survey, it took a really long time for it to load. That was my only technical issue. ""}","comments","survey-text","228","1494370","0.0-24.0","27972","632141","lowRank"
