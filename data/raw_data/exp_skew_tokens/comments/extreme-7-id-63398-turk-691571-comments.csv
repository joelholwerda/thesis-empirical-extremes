"171598","{""Q0"":""I did not encounter any technical problems; the instructions were clear. For my choices, in the beginning, I was looking to find patterns. After finding what I thought were the higher choices, I tended to pick that first. By the end of it, I think I determined one block was always a set value, and the other block was a choice either a little higher or a little lower than the first block. I think I tended to go with the 'random' block more often.""}","comments","survey-text","228","1522740","0.0-24.0","63398","691571","lowRank"
