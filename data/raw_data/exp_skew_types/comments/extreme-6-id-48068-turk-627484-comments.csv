"398523","{""Q0"":""My strategy was never choose yellow because it is worth 0 points. I always chose blue because, more often than not, it was worth 70 points.\n\nI don't know if you intend for workers to be able to do this HIT more than once. If you don't, you should block people from doing it repeatedly based one their worker ID (I know this can be done) or explicitly state in your instructions that this HIT can only be done one time, and repeat HIT submissions will be rejected. You did neither. If you don't mind repeat HIT's, then please disregard. This is the second time I have done this HIT. I actually have a third one in my queue right now, but I'm going to return it. I don't want to taint the results of your experiment just so I can keep getting money.""}","comments","survey-text","239","1653500","0.0-20.0","48068","627484","lowRank"
