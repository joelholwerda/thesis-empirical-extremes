"139513","{""Q0"":""I noticed that the blue boxes yielded the most consistently lowest numbers. After a while, I just stopped hitting the blue boxes. Every now and then I would hit a blue box to see if the criteria had changed. When I noticed that it didn't, I just stopped hitting the blue box completely.\n\nI noticed that the green boxes were consistently 70 or 30 and that the yellow boxes were always 50. It made no real difference to me, but I had hoped that I could score more 70's than 30's, otherwise it would add up to the same as if I always selected the yellow box (50). \n\nThe red box was the most unpredictable, yet it gave me more chances to get more points so I would select that over the blue box almost every time. No technical issues were observed.""}","comments","survey-text","239","1087810","0.0-20.0","34119","822206","lowRank"
