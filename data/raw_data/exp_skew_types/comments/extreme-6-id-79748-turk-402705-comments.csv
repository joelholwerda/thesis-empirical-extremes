"118370","{""Q0"":""My strategies came to me naturally as the experiment went on. I picked the blue option three times in a row and received zero points every time, which led me to pick the red option every single time, no matter what. Every time that I picked the blue option, I received zero points. Picking between yellow and green was much more difficult. Yellow seemed to be set at 50 points, and that was always tempting, especially after a couple of bad red picks. However, I did pick green at times, as well, as I had a 50/50 chance of landing on 70 instead of 30.""}","comments","survey-text","239","1151637","0.0-20.0","79748","402705","lowRank"
