"131176","{""Q0"":""I learned with repeated trials that the red choice did not yield any points so I favored green over red. In terms of the blue and yellow, I tried to choose the one that yielded more points but found that points given for each of these two colors seemed to change within each trial. So it was difficult to predict but I tried as much as possible to choose the color with the higher points, if I could keep track of it and not get confused, which may have happened.
