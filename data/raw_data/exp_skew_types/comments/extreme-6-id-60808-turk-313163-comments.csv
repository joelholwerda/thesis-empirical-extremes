"334014","{""Q0"":""When I first started the experiment, I made my decisions based on what a particular color meant to me. For example, I associated the yellow with my favorite sports team. From there, I started noticing patterns and would try to stick with what I thought I knew about (like the green box would probably have 50 points and the blue would likely have zero). I did take gambles here and there (click on a blue box, for example) to see if the points had switched at all between colors. I don't believe there were any technical issues. Once, I believe it was during the second set, I think I had to click the 'Next' button twice, but that could easily have been my computer mouse pad being glitch-y. Overall, I absolutely loved this experiment! It was one of the most enjoyable studies I've had the pleasure to partake in. Thank you so very much for offering this study. All the very best to you- ""}","comments","survey-text","239","1860474","0.0-20.0","60808","313163","highRank"
