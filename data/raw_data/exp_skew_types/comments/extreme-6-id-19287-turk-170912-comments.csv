"160790","{""Q0"":""In the first set of trials, I experimented with combinations and chose each of the different colors at one point in order to try and figure out if there was a pattern to the values. I found that whenever I chose the blue option, I received zero points. I began to avoid choosing blue once I realized that I could not find a pattern of choices that would lead to blue yielding points. I noticed that the red option always gave fifty points, the yellow option would give either thirty or seventy points, and the green option seemed to give a random number of points between one to one hundred. I used these observations to weigh my choices to maximize the points I could accrue. ""}","comments","survey-text","239","1320240","0.0-20.0","19287","170912","highRank"
