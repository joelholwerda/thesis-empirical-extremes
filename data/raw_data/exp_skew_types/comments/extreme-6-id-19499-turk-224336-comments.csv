"163844","{""Q0"":""For a while, I kept trying to click the green square to see whether it would ever vary. In my experience, it was never worth more than 0 points, so whenever it was presented with the blue square, I would always choose the blue square. Even 4 points from choosing the blue square was better than 0 from choosing the green square.\n\nI also experimented with the red square, and found that it only seemed to result in 70 points when it was presented alone. In general, when it was presented with the yellow square, it was worth 30 points, whereas the yellow square was reliably worth 50 points. While continuing to click the red square was tempting, to see whether I would be surprised, I ended up with 30 points enough times that when the red square was presented with the yellow square, I chose yellow. I would rather have had 50 points than 30.""}","comments","survey-text","239","1576768","0.0-20.0","19499","224336","highRank"
