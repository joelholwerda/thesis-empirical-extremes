"86949","{""Q0"":""When I was presented with only one option, I was able to see how many points I would get for clicking on it. Every time I clicked on red when it was the only option, I received 0 points. So I avoided clicking on red whenever there were two options available. I also noticed that green was almost always worth more than blue when I had two options available. When blue was the only option available I would receive 70 points which was more than the green one.""}","comments","survey-text","239","941636","0.0-20.0","94013","875352","highRank"
