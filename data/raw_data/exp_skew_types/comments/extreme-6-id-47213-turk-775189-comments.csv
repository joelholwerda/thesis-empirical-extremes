"203680","{""Q0"":""Well when there was only 1 block as a choice, and the red block was 50 points or higher, i assumed that both the red and yellow block adds up to 100 points. So i used that assumption (whether that may be valid or not) to always stick to red if It was 50 points or higher. I also figured that in the long run, it's best to stick with one color block (apart from green lol) as you will accrue more points.\n\nAs for technical problems, you have to copy the link in new browser. Using it within Mturk's interface will not show the \""Next\"" button for some reason.""}","comments","survey-text","239","1056786","0.0-20.0","47213","775189","lowRank"
