"370144","{""Q0"":""no technical problems and everything was clear. I will explain my strategy.  I first wanted to select each different color box a few times in order to get an idea for what points they would each be worth.  then after realizing that green was always 0 I knew to always chose yellow because yellow as always worth 1 or more points.  Then the choice between red and blue.  I decided to chose blue every time because it was a guaranteed 50 points as compared to the red which could sometimes be only 30 points.
