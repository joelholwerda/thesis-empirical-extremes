"230592","{""Q0"":""I chose red almost every time because each blue I chose always ended up 0 points for me. I usually chose green when it was on the left side because that seemed to give me 70 points more frequently. Whenever I was unsure with green or yellow I chose yelllow for 50 points every time. The task was very straightforward and I experienced no problems. Very interesting study! I appreciate the opportunity to participate.""}","comments","survey-text","239","1413565","0.0-20.0","18468","115365","lowRank"
