"261745","{""Q0"":""It quickly became apparent that yellow always rewarded 0 points, so selecting Green over it was always the dominant strategy. When selecting between Red and Blue my strategy was to minimize downside risk. Both have an expected value of 50 (for Red a 100% chance that you earn 50 points; for Blue a 50% chance you earn 30 and 50% chance that you earn 70). While there was the chance that in such a small sample I could have in fact earned 70 points for blue more than 50% of the time, the same was also true for earning 30. Red became my strategy as I wanted to minimize risk.  ""}","comments","survey-text","239","1465873","0.0-20.0","5005","711094","highRank"
