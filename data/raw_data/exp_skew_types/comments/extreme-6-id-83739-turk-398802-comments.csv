Given that continuity wasn’t certain, after the first two pauses I tried red a few times to see if there was a pattern change and there was not so blue was my only option I picked.\n\nGreen was always 50. Yellow alternated between 70 and 30. I tried to figure out a pattern. In my estimation yellow was 70 about 2/3 of the time but in no particular order and I can’t be certain it was 2/3 because I didn’t keep track until towards the end. I tried to guess when it would be 30 and selected green toward the end every 3rd choice between yellow and green""}","comments","survey-text","245","1254108","0.0-20.0","83739","398802","lowRank"
