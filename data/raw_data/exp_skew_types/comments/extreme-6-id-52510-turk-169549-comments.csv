"155989","{""Q0"":""I noticed the blue block output nothing but 0 pretty early-on, and I assumed that there was a similar imbalance with the yellow and red blocks (with red always being lower than yellow). Once I got stuck with the red block option and it showed me 70 points, I tried the blue block again to see if it also had variation (surprise, it didn't!). I avoided the blue block completely after the 3rd round and tended to pick the red block more than the yellow block, as I noticed I was getting 70 more frequently.
