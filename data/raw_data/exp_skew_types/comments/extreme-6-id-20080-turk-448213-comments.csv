"101943","{""Q0"":""Blue always had points, while yellow seemed to never have points, so after a couple of tests I always picked blue in the choice of blue vs yellow.  Red was always 50, while green would fluctuate between 30 and 70, though 70 seemed more often earlier on and 30 much more often later on.  I would originally prefer green, but then would prefer red, selecting a green occasionally to see what happened.""}","comments","survey-text","239","1464358","0.0-20.0","20080","448213","highRank"
