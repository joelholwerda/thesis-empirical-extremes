"581313","{""Q0"":""I started off at first just trying to see how many points each color choice was worth. I quickly realized Blue seemed to always result in 0 and stopped choosing Blue. I then realized Yellow resulted in 70 to 30 points, but that 30 kept coming up more than 70, so according to my calculations it was a better choice to go for green every-time rather than possibly only getting 30pts. Red was always better than Blue even when it yielded lower outcomes, so I always picked red when it was available, although I was curious if Blue ever resulted in anything other than 0. But, because 0 came up so much It wasn't worth trying to figure it out.""}","comments","survey-text","239","1973972","0.0-20.0","8712","463513","highRank"
