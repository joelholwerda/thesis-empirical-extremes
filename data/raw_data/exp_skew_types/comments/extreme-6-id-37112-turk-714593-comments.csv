"258608","{""Q0"":""I mainly stuck with green and blue. Blue had a wide variety of points, green was always 50, red was either 30 or 70, and yellow was always 0.\nGreen was always paired with red, so I almost always chose green. The times I deviated I never received the 70, so green was safer.\nThe extremely few times I decided to try yellow when it wasn't by itself were always 0, so I choose blue.
