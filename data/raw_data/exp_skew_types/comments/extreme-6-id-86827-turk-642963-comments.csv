"91555","{""Q0"":""I started to notice a pattern after the first block, I stopped picking the green because I noticed it was always/usually 0 points. Blue I associated with 100 points so I always picked that because it was paired with green. For red and yellow, since they were paired together I would alternate which one I picked but I leaned toward red because I associated it with 50 and yellow with 30 or 70.
